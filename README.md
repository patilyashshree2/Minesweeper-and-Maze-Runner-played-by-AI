# Minesweeper-and-Maze-Runner-played-by-AI
Created Minesweeper game in python, both Normal and AI-based, with some modifications in the AI-based minesweeper. Created Mazerunner game using the methods (BFS, DFS, A-Star) separately. An extra mode was added to it - an active fire module (A fire spreads from one corner of the board) with a goal to solve the maze without getting caught in the fire.
